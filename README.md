# 0x00. AirBnB clone - The console

## Description
### Phase 1: Basic Console Creation for AirBnB Clone

This project consists of four phases aimed at creating a functional clone of the AirBnB web application.
 The first phase focuses on developing a basic console using the Cmd Python module.
 The console serves as a management tool for the project's objects and enables the implementation of essential methods such
 as create, show, update, all, and destroy for the existing classes and subclasses.
